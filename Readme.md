A simple naming app created with Node.js and React.js (MongoDB integration follows) (still in development)

## Getting Started

Navigate into folder and type 

```
npm install
```
After that run webpack with 

```
npm run dev
```
and start the server 

```
npm start
```



### Notes

If the server fails to start follow the steps bellow:

open in terminal

```
~./bash_profile
```

paste and save

```
source ~/.profile

export PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin

```


Without it, you would need to navigate into the node module directory everytime to start the server.
